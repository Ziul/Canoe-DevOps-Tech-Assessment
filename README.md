# Canoe DevOps Tech Assessment API

## Goal
Demonstrate familiarity with Docker containers and some software development skills(especially how a RESTful API is built in a Docker
image and deployed to ECS Fargate)

## About This Repository
This repository contains two main folders: one for the [RESTful API](/api/) and another for the [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](/terraform/). Each folder includes a `README.md` file with instructions on how to use the respective components.
